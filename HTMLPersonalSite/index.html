  <!-- There are quiet a few meta elements but we are using 'charset' here.
    We are setting this element to 'utf-8'.
    The meta element gives extra associated data to html file.
    In this case we tell the browser that the content in our website is encoded
    in 'utf-8'. If the browser uses incorrect charecter decoding for our
    content, it will result to mojibake -- "garbled text that is the result of
    text being decoded using an unintended character encoding". utf-8 is the
    standard encoding we should use wile encoding the HTML file, because it
    includes all of those international symols and infact all the symbols
    encoded in the unicode charecter set.

    Another advantage of meta tag is you can enter site descriptions.
    That's what search engines do. They crawl the HTML of our website, and
    search for description meta tags to find out what your website is about and
    how to display it in our search index -->
